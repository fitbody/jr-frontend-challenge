# Rick and Morty App!

The main objective of this challenge is to test your abilities as a front-end developer.

## Challenge

Create a web application that shows every **Rick and Morty** character with its description.
> **Note:** For this challenge you must use ReactJs or VueJs. Also you can use design libraries such as [Ant Design](https://ant.design), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [React bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io), among others.

### Instructions

You'll have to consume the following REST API: [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com)

 1. First view: 
	- Get list with every character, this view must be displayed in a [GRID](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and has to be shown as a card list [Card view](https://material.io/develop/android/components/cards/), in which you'll have to show the character's most important data, [take as reference the same page for this cards](https://rickandmortyapi.com).
	- Must have a search bar with the functionality of search character by name.
	- BONUS: Implement pagination on the list.
 2. Second view: when clicking a character in the first view you should be redirected to a new view and display the character with all its data. In this view you must be able to add or remove a character as "favorite" (state management).
 3. Third view: must display the characters marked as "favorite".
 4. All views must be responsive. Remember: "Mobile First".
 5. When you are done with the task, send the repository link to your recruiter.

### How to submit your work?

1. ##### First you need to fork this repository.

2. ##### Then clone your fork locally.

3. ##### Install the app locally.

4. ##### Once you've completed your work, you can submit a pull-request to the remote repository.

### General guidelines.
You can use any library for the UI design but if you want to use none, it's cool.
You are free to use any third party service when fetching the API.

**Best of luck**
